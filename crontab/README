These are the 2 files which should be used in a Linux environment using crontab

If using Linux type (without the '$'):

$ crontab -e

This will open up a textfile.

At the bottom of the file add:

* * * * * /dir/to/file/checkAccTime.sh

Where "/dir/to/file/" should be replace with the directory you saved "checkAccTime.sh"

From here, crontab should run this script every minute and delete any accounts that last activity was longer than 30 days ago

**Please note: Updates to the last_active attribute in the accounts table should be updated when using the account.
This must be added to the other php files that involve the use of a checking or savings account!
